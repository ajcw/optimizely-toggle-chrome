#Optimizely Toggle Chrome

##What is it?

This is a Chrome extension that disables Optimizely for the tab you are browsing, via a switch.

##How do I use it?

Once the [extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/optimizely-toggle-for-chr/eaoflpgigmnhpmdgnphpomomaflfglmj?authuser=1) is installed on your browser, you can toggle a simple switch to disable (OFF) or enable (ON) Optimizely experiments on the current page (see screenshots).

Optimizely is enabled by default, can be disabled clicking on the switch and getting as a result the screenshot below:
