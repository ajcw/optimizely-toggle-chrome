#Optimizely Toggle Chrome

##What is it?

A Chrome extension which can disable Optimizely for your current tab.

##How do I use it?

Once the [extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/optimizely-toggle-for-chr/eaoflpgigmnhpmdgnphpomomaflfglmj?authuser=1) is installed on your browser, you can toggle a simple switch to disable (OFF) or enable (ON) Optimizely experiments on the current page (see screenshots).

Optimizely is enabled by default and can be disabled by clicking the switch. An example of this is shown in the screenshot below:
